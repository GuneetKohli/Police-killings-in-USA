# Police-killings-in-USA
Due in part to recent high-profile shootings of civilians by police in the US, the media and public have been scrutinizing police killings heavily. FiveThirtyEight assembled a dataset using crowdsourced data from Guardian and census data. It contains information on each police killing in the US. You can find it [here] (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings).

Each of the 467 rows in the dataset contains information on a police killing of a civilian in the US in from January 2015 to June 2015.
